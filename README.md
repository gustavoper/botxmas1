## What is this? 

This is a project using Twitter's API to control my christmas tree.


## Ok but how? 

The purpose is simple: I'd like to control my Christmas tree lights using an Arduino and Raspberry Pi, through a DM via  Twitter.

At the moment, I'll be using [this account](https://twitter.com/botxmas1).

## What's the actual status? 

### 2022-04-23

- Creating accounts and setting up Twitter's API;
- I'm not sure if Twitter will ban my account due to their strict rules about bots, but I'll try in any case.
